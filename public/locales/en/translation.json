  "faq": {
    "title": "FAQ",
    "question1": "What is RFID technology and how does it benefit libraries?",
    "answer1": "RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to books and materials. It enables faster check-in/check-out processes, automated inventory management, enhanced security, and improved patron experience through self-service stations.",
    "question2": "How long does it take to implement RFID in our library?",
    "answer2": "Implementation time varies depending on library size and collection volume. Typically, a small to medium library takes 2-4 weeks, while larger institutions may require 6-8 weeks. This includes system setup, staff training, and material tagging. We provide a detailed timeline during consultation.",
    "question3": "What support and training do you provide after installation?",
    "answer3": "We provide comprehensive staff training, detailed user manuals, and ongoing technical support. Our support package includes system maintenance, software updates, troubleshooting assistance, and 24/7 helpdesk service. We also offer refresher training sessions as needed.",
    "question4": "Can RFID systems integrate with existing library management software?",
    "answer4": "Yes, our RFID solutions are designed to integrate seamlessly with most existing library management systems (LMS). As official Bibliotheca partners, we ensure compatibility with popular LMS platforms and provide custom integration services when needed to maintain your current workflows."
